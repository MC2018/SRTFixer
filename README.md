# SRTFixer
 A simple tool that allows one to offset poorly-timed subtitles by X milliseconds. I originally made it for my personal use when trying to practice language learning. I couldn't stand the subtitles being two seconds off from the actual video, so this was created.
 
 The arguments are as follows (with charset as optional):
 input_file output_file millis_offset charset
